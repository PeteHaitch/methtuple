  # Creating the overlap is a two-step process. (1) Find the intersection of positions_1 and positions_2 (excluding None positions); (2) Define the overlap as all positions between the smallest element and largest element of the overlap set.
  # The second step is necessary because there may be bases in the overlap where one of the reads has a deletion. For example, consider the following overlap (ol) of read_1 (r1) and read_2 (r2) using "=" to represent aligned bases, "x" to represent deletions and "+" to represent insertions and soft-clips:
  # ol:  |----|
  # r1: ==xx===
  # r2:  =========
  # The overlap is 6bp long but r1 has a deletion of 2bp. While this is arguably a bad alignment, it does occur in practice and so needs to be appropriately dealt with.
  # It is very difficult to identify the boundary of an overlap if there are insertions or soft-clipped bases near the ends. For example:
  # ol:      |-|
  # r1: ==+++===
  # r2:    ++======
  # The start of this overlap (leftmost position) doesn't map to this position in the reference genome. Furthermore, the leftmost base of r2 might be soft-clipped
  # I don't know whether this can actually occur in practice. And perhaps it can be resolved with CIGAR operations but it's going to be very fiddly and, quite frankly, I've spent enough time on what I believe to be a very rare problem.
  # Therefore, for simplicity, I define the overlap by the leftmost and rightmost positions that have a position in the reference genome. So, if the overlap is an insertion (resp. soft-clip) then there is, not quite correctly (resp. correctly), no overlap by this method.
