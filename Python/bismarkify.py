def get_padded_ref_seq(read, ref, IN): # 'read' is an AlignedRead object, 'ref' is a FastaFile object
    """Extract reference sequence +/- 2bp of the location of a mapped read. The various cases are to ensure that all possible cases are considered, such as when the read maps to the start (end) of a contig and therefore there are no prior (subsequent) 2 bases to extract. The result is padded with 'N' characters in the cases where there is no reference sequence at the start or end positions. In its current form this function cannot handle a read that is longer than its mapped-contig at each end, e.g. a 100bp read containing a 98bp contig internally, but these shouldn't exist and would likely not be mapped even if such short contigs did exist.
