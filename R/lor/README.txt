The <sampleID>.lor file contains the estimated log-odds ratios (and their standard errors) for the <sampleID>. This is computed by aggregating across intra-pair distances (d) for each chromosome. The result is a list of 80-vectors of LORs (and their accompanying standard errors), with each element of the list corresponding to a chromosome.
